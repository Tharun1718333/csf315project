Hi folks
This is a basic app where I experimented on taking surveys from users who are not literate and has difficulty in using a smartphone.



How the basic survey in the app works:-
1, the user can see the step he is in and he has an option to resume the survey
2, the user can give his input in the form of speech and he can confirm it by playing the recording of his input
3, user can select different for different options while the question is conveyed by playing a recording(different color for different options)


extra features I added:-
1, voice to text (using Google API)
2, use the text generated in the google search inside the app itself
3, in-app google assistant (use google API)

The whole code and the images and recording all are on the src folder. 
I suggest replicating if you need any of them instead of searching for them.
Feel free to use it in any of your work!!
